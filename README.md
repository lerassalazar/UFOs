# UFOs
# Overview
### In this analysis, we made a webpage that allowed us to extract multiple data points at the same time. We created subsections, headers, and summaries. 
# Results
### 5 elements were created and filters were added. By using javascript, she can filter between state, city, country, and shape. 
# Summary 
### These updates provide a better UX that will allow users to find information more easily. It might make a difference to the users if the data array was wider, as well as perhaps a map where you could trace where these sightings are taking place.
